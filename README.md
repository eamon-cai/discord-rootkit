# Discord-rootkit
Shit ahh readme

# Usage
> Go into main and replace values serverid, userid fetch links and bot tokens

> Compile with nuitka and use the --disable-console

# Why is it better than popular rootkits?
> ATM its not... but the popular ones on github like pysilon for example are very very detected and will get ur acc and server termed in like 2 days

> Anyway remeber actual rats that run on via actual servers will ALWAYS be better bc of these reasons
> 1. Discord limits channels
> 2. If ur bot or account gets termed u can lose victims
> 3. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE its eazy asf for somone to get the bot token and then view all servers/messages etc the bot is in

# Info
> Its not very detected but it does almost nothng ATM if u want to make it way more ud delete UAC bypass and defender shit (Useless ATM)

> Made just 4fun idk how often gonna update this

> Use the cls command often so ur bot does not get detected by discord also dont change the names bc they will prob get also detected

> ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP BOT
